## Q1. How would you design a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for deploying applications on AWS?

**Answer:**

1. **Understand the Requirements**
   - 👨‍💻 Interact with developers to gather:
     - Number of applications to be deployed.
     - Application requirements (compute, storage, database).
   - Based on this, define the **CIDR block** for the VPC.

2. **Subnet Design**
   - 🌐 **Public Subnet** → Internet-facing components (Load Balancer).
   - 🔒 **Private Subnet** → Application Servers & Databases.
   - Assign appropriate **CIDR ranges** for each subnet.

3. **Load Balancer Placement**
   - ⚖️ Deploy an **ELB/ALB/NLB** in the **Public Subnet**.
   - Configure it to forward traffic to **target groups** in the private subnet.

4. **Application Deployment**
   - 🖥️ Launch **EC2 instances** (application servers) in the **Private Subnet**.
   - ⚡ Configure them with **Auto Scaling Group** for high availability & scalability.
   - Deploy the application server software on these instances.

5. **Database Layer**
   - 📦 **Option 1:** Self-managed DB in a separate private subnet.  
   - ☁️ **Option 2:** Managed DB service (RDS/Aurora) depending on requirements.

6. **Traffic Flow**
   - 🌍 Client → **Load Balancer (Public Subnet)**  
   - ⚖️ Load Balancer → **Application Servers (Private Subnet, ASG)**  
   - 🖥️ Application Servers → **Database (Private Subnet / RDS)**  
   - 🔄 Response → Back through same path  

7. **Security Considerations**
   - 🛡️ Proper **CIDR sizing** to avoid overlap.  
   - 🔒 Keep application servers & databases in **Private Subnets**.  
   - 🧰 Use **Security Groups** and **NACLs** for access control.  

8. **Key Benefits**
   - 📈 **Scalability** → Auto Scaling Groups.  
   - ☑️ **High Availability** → Load Balancer + Multi-AZ.  
   - 🔒 **Security** → Private subnets + fine-grained controls.  
   - ⚙️ **Flexibility** → Choice of managed (RDS) or self-managed DB.

### ***Interview Ready answer***
If I am asked to design a VPC on AWS, I would start by understanding the application requirements and
then define the CIDR block for the VPC. Within the VPC, I would create both public and private subnets—placing
the load balancer in the public subnet and application servers in the private subnet,
configured with an Auto Scaling Group for scalability and high availability. The application servers would connect to a database,
which I would either deploy in a separate private subnet for isolation or use a managed service like RDS depending on requirements.
External traffic would enter through the load balancer, get routed to the application servers, and then to the database,
with responses flowing back through the same path. Security is ensured by proper CIDR sizing,
keeping sensitive components in private subnets, and controlling access using security groups and NACLs.
This design ensures a scalable, highly available, and secure architecture.
