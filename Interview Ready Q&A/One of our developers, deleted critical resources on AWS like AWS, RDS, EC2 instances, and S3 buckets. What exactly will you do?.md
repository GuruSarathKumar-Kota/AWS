## ❓ The Interview Question
👉 *“One of your developers deleted critical resources (RDS, EC2, S3). What will you do?”*  

The interviewer is testing **crisis handling** (short-term) + **preventive governance** (long-term).  

---

## ⚡ Step 1: Immediate Action (Recovery)

- **Amazon S3**  
  - If **versioning enabled** → recover files from previous versions.  
  - If replication enabled → restore from backup region.  

- **Amazon RDS**  
  - Use **Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)** to recover DB to the last consistent state.  
  - Use **automated snapshots** or **manual backups** if PITR not available.  

- **Amazon EC2**  
  - Recover from **AMIs** or **snapshots** of attached EBS volumes.  
  - Recreate EC2 instance and attach restored volumes.  

✅ These actions **reduce downtime** and unblock teams immediately.

## 🔧 Step 2: Long-Term Solution (Prevention)

1. **IAM & Access Control**
   - Apply **least privilege principle** 🔒  
   - Developers should **not** have delete permissions for critical resources.  
   - Use **IAM roles & policies** with fine-grained access.  
   - Regular **IAM audits** to identify risky permissions.  

2. **RBAC & Zero Trust**
   - Apply **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
   - Ensure only DevOps/admins can manage production resources.  

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Manage AWS resources using **Terraform** or **CloudFormation**.  
   - Integrate with **Git (version control)** for approvals, rollback, and audit.  
   - No manual creation/deletion in production.  

4. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Enable **AWS CloudTrail** to track deletions.  
   - Use **Amazon GuardDuty** or **Config rules** to detect unauthorized changes.

### 💡 Interview-Ready Answer
If a developer deletes critical AWS resources like RDS, EC2, or S3, my immediate action would be to restore services quickly. For S3, I’d use versioning or backups; for RDS, I’d perform a Point-in-Time Restore; and for EC2, I’d recreate the instance using snapshots and AMIs. These recovery steps minimize downtime and unblock users.

For the long-term solution, I would strengthen access controls by applying least privilege IAM policies and using RBAC so developers cannot delete critical production resources. Additionally, I would enforce Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation) to manage AWS resources via version control (Git), ensuring auditing and rollback. Finally, I’d enable CloudTrail, Config, and GuardDuty for continuous monitoring and alerts on unauthorized deletions.

This shows I can handle emergencies while also preventing recurrence through strong governance and automation.
