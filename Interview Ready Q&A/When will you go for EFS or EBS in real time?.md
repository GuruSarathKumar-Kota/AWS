## 📘 What is EFS?  
- **EFS (Elastic File System)** = **Shared file storage** service.  
- Multiple EC2 instances can **concurrently access the same file system** via **NFS protocol**.  
- **Use Cases:**  
  - Shared application config files  
  - Image processing pipelines  
  - Kubernetes clusters (pods across nodes needing shared storage)  
- 🌍 Scalable, serverless, distributed file system.  

---

## 📘 What is EBS?  
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** = **Block-level storage volume** attached to **a single EC2 instance**.  
- Provides **low-latency, high-performance storage**.  
- Volumes persist beyond the life of an EC2 instance.  
- **Use Cases:**  
  - Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) 📊  
  - Applications needing **high IOPS** (transaction-heavy workloads)  
  - Boot volumes for EC2 instances

## ⚖️ When to Use EFS vs EBS  

| Feature/Criteria              | **EFS (Elastic File System)** 📂 | **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** 💽 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Access Mode**               | Shared (multi-instance)                        | Single-instance only             |
| **Protocol**                  | NFS                                            | Block storage (direct attach)    |
| **Performance**               | Scalable but higher latency                    | Low latency, high IOPS           |
| **Best For**                  | Shared workloads, Kubernetes, image processing | Databases, transactional systems |
| **Scalability**               | Automatically scalable 📈                      | Must resize manually             |
| **Durability/Backup**         | Region-level durability                        | Snapshots (manual/auto)          |
| **Pricing**                   | Pay per GB, scalable                           | Pay per GB, provisioned upfront  |

### 💡 Example: Relational Database (Postgres, MySQL) requiring high IOPS and low latency.

### 🎯 Interview-Ready Summary
“In real-world usage, I would choose EFS when I need shared storage across multiple EC2 instances — for example, in a Kubernetes cluster where multiple pods across nodes need concurrent access to the same files, such as in an image processing application. On the other hand, I would choose EBS when I need dedicated, high-performance block storage attached to a single EC2 instance — for example, when running a database where low latency and high IOPS are critical. To summarize: EFS = scalable shared file system, while EBS = high-performance dedicated block storage.”
