## ❓ The Interview Question
👉 *“What will you do when AWS RDS storage is full?”*  

Most people stop at: *“I’ll just increase the RDS storage.”*  
But that solves **only 10% of the problem**. An interview-ready answer must show **instant + long-term strategy**.

## ⚡ Step 1: Instant Solution (Unblock Users)
1. Go to **AWS RDS console**.  
2. **Take a snapshot** (backup) before making any changes.  
3. **Increase allocated storage** OR migrate to a **larger RDS instance with more storage**.  
4. (Optional) Enable **storage autoscaling** (if supported).

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Long-Term Fixes
After unblocking users, investigate **why storage filled up**:
- **Database-level analysis**
  - Identify which **database** is consuming most space  
  - Example (Postgres):  
    ```sql
    SELECT datname, pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) 
    FROM pg_database;
    ```
- **Table-level analysis**
  - Identify largest tables:
  - 
    SELECT relname AS table, 
           pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid)) AS size 
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_statio_user_tables 
    ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;
    ```
- **Object-level analysis**
  - Check indexes, cache tables, duplicates, or unused objects.  
- **Work with DBAs / Developers**
  - Optimize queries, vacuum/analyze tables, drop unused objects.  
  - Consider **partitioning large tables**.  

---

## 📡 Step 3: Proactive Monitoring
- Enable **Amazon CloudWatch** alarms for:
  - `FreeStorageSpace` metric (alert before storage hits critical).  
  - Set SNS notifications for proactive alerts.  
- Automate responses (Lambda or EventBridge) to increase storage before it fills.  
- Regularly review **RDS performance insights** to detect abnormal growth.

### 💡 Interview-Ready Answer
If RDS storage becomes full, my first priority is to unblock users immediately. I would take a snapshot for backup and then increase the allocated storage or switch to a larger instance, possibly enabling storage autoscaling if supported.

But this only fixes the symptom. For a long-term solution, I would analyze the database using SQL queries to find which databases, tables, or objects are consuming abnormal space. Then I’d collaborate with DBAs or developers to optimize queries, clean up unnecessary objects, or restructure tables to prevent future issues.

Finally, I would set up CloudWatch alarms on the FreeStorageSpace metric and configure proactive alerts so that storage expansion or cleanup can be done before users are impacted.

This approach balances immediate recovery + root cause analysis + proactive monitoring, which convinces interviewers that I can handle real-world operational challenges.
